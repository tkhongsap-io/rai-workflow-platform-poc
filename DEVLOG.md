# Development log

## README journey: 2026-09-21

Added the review journey, correction loop and completion gates to README. Demo behavior and unresolved production authority remain explicit. Documentation only; [change review](changes/2026-09-21-readme-user-journey/review.md) records verification.

## Video preview: 2026-09-21

Created a 30-second True RAI product-motion video from actual demo captures, inspired by an inspected Cursor launch video. MP4 decoding and QuickTime playback verified. Assets and renderer are in [media/demo-video](media/demo-video/README.md); [review](changes/2026-09-21-demo-video/review.md) records limits. Merged through PR #3 (`824eaa7`); not posted to social media.

## Current state: 2026-09-21

The local demo's revised functional gate passed: 22 unit/provenance tests and four UI-driven localhost suites. Fixed invalid Admin publication and a discard-control regression found during retesting. Original Claude export is immutable; intentional local corrections are declared in demo/reference/local-adaptations.json. Ta accepts small visual differences, so literal raster equality is no longer a blocker. See [functional gate](changes/2026-09-21-local-design-demo/functional-gate.md). Owner authorized commit, PR and merge after the functional gate passed. Production W0–W8 remain unstarted.

## Previous state: 2026-09-20

Product anchors: [PRD](PRD.md) and [BUILD_PLAN](BUILD_PLAN.md). Build packages W0-W8 are not started.

Documentation foundation and interactive Claude Design prototype prepared. Core synthetic owner/SPOC/reviewer/admin journey browser-tested; responsive/copy corrections completed and affected paths retested. See [handoff](docs/design/DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md) and [test evidence](docs/design/TEST_RUNS.md). Application implementation has not started. No production services, dependencies, models, data stores or deployments exist. Prototype UI observations are not application runtime acceptance.

Owner: Ta. Proposed gate operator: Nakhun (confirmation pending). Organization-level acceptance is not established by this repository.

## Next gates

1. Operator confirmation and AI/COE document-mapping decision.
2. Explicit Ta start instruction, followed by a stack ADR and slice-1 implementation plan.
3. Implement and prove one synthetic case end to end, then add evaluated QC, risk proposal, admin controls and operator rehearsal.

The current [change review](changes/2026-09-20-documentation-foundation/review.md) records documentation verification. The [decision register](docs/product/decisions.md) owns remaining gaps.
